### Open Portal API

Open Portal API is an open-source project that provides a template for building a RESTful API to manage leads in a relational database. The API is built using Java and the Spring Boot Web framework.

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Well-defined endpoints for interacting with the API.
- **Pagination**: Support for pagination to manage large sets of leads.
- **Validation**: Input data validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Security**: Basic authentication for API access.
- **Logging**: Logging of API requests and responses for monitoring.
- **Integration**:
  - **Email**: Send notifications via email for lead updates.
  - **Slack**: Notify users on Slack about new leads.
  - **WhatsApp**: Send WhatsApp messages to users for lead notifications.

#### Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for the API.
- **Spring Boot Web**: A framework for building RESTful APIs with Java.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access using the Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **MySQL**: The relational database used for storing lead information.
